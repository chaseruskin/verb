<!--
This changelog follows a very particular format. 

Only the title 'changelog' may begin with 1 pound symbol '#'. 

Every version partition must begin with 2 pound symbols '##'. 

Any section under a version must begin wtih 3 pound symbols '###'. 

This is important for the auto-changelog extraction occuring during the CI/CD 
pipeline to list only the current verion's changes with every release.

Add `- unreleased` along the next future version to prevent CI/CD from triggering release mechanism.
